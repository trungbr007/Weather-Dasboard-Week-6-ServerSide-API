# Weather-Dasboard-Week-6-ServerSide-API

I created a page which displays all the infomation followed by mocking-up photo.
After that, Fetch openweather API 5 days to get the data and pull it into the code.
However, I figured out I can only get current date information. It meant I do not have list section in the array so I could not get the 5 days forecast properly.
